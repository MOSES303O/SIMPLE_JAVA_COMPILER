# SIMPLE_JAVA_COMPILER
Just trying to illustrate how a java compiler works using java codes itself.
Most compilers boilto three simple forms that is PARSING;TRASFORMATIONS and CODE GENERATION.
Parsing is taking of raw code and turning it into a more abstract represenatation of the code.
Trasformation this is where to u take this abstract representation and manipulate to do whatever the compiler wants it to do.
Code Generation taakes n the trasformed representation of the code and turns it into new code.
Basically l have splitted all the above {PARSING,TRASFORMATION,CODE GENERATION} into important class which l choose to call "submain codes":perser class,Tokenize class,......
